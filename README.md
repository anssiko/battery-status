Battery Status Events Playground
==============

A JavaScript implementation of a Battery Status Events draft.

This demo implements the Battery Status Events specification and simulates battery-powered user agent behavior. You can adjust the battery level and whether the device is plugged in from the controls below. A blink of an event name indicates the event has been fired.
